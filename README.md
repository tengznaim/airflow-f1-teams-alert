# F1 News Microsoft Teams Alert using Airflow and MS Teams Webhooks

This is a simple workflow that extracts Formula 1 (I like F1) news articles using the NewsAPI and sends an alert to a Microsoft Teams channel. Hence, this is a test implementation of using the Microsoft Teams webhooks in Airflow. By using Airflow, this process is scheduled to occur, for example, daily to get new articles for the day.
